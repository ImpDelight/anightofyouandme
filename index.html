<i> My Wife, </i>
</h2>

<p>
After reading two letters, I thought I'd let you read a poem that I tried to write for you. Now, I know I'm not a good poet or anywhere as good as your favorites but it has been one of my goals to always be your favorite poet, even if I suck at poems, you know? If someone were to ask you who is your favorite poet, I would love for you to say my boyfriend, but shush, I understand that I suck at poems but worry not. I will get there, one day, perhaps. Anyway, I wrote a little something for us, I'm hoping you will like it, if not, well, what can you do. ðŸ™‚

<h3>
On a certain Sunday night of 8th August, 2027 - the world for us would revolve around each other's bodies. With fully developed bodies and a fully developed mind - we'd be falling for each other with fully developed hearts and a fully developed love. <br>
In a room, of a motel, on a street - full of rows of motels and hotels, would be a bed - for you and me. My Aphrodite, my Queen, my Wife, my Babygirl, my Nuzhat - and me, your lover. <br>
With a bottle of beer in our hands, our minds hazy and the idea of love on our tongue - would we stand together, against the closed door. <br>
My eyes would be full of love - for you, for me, for us. And I would take sips from my bottle as you would giggle. <br>
Giggle at my drunken state, my drunk face and my slurred speech - as I would tell you how much you mean to me. <br>
I would turn to you and watch you giggle through your eyes and your lips - mesmerized by the sheer brilliance of the epitomical beauty in front of me. <br>
Overwhelmed with love, I would caress the side of your face, tucking your hair behind your ears, finally grazzing my thumb over your lips. <br>
You - still in your drunken state of happiness and bliss - would be aware of the actions to follow and your lips would react to my touches. <br>
You would take a sip from your beer and I would lean closer to kiss that leftover drop of alcohol on your lips. <br>
A rush of ecstasy and bliss would burst into our bodies - taking us to a transcedental plane of existence - just you and me. <br>
I would look at you in your one piece, hair tied in a bun, strands falling on either side of your face, eyes full of sparkle, smirk on your lips, bliss peeking through your cheeks, taste of acohol on your tongue. <br>
You would push me closer to you before taking another sip from your bottle - only to envelope me into your arms and to plant your lips on mine, a battle of tongues and lips erupts. <br>
I would drop the bottle and hold you tightly, closer to my body, feeling the whole of you against me. A palm stretched on your back - pulling you closer. Another crossed behind you and over to your shoulder - hugging you deeply. <br>
We would sigh and relax ourselves into each other's arms - finally letting our chaos bid adieu to us. At peace - you and me - into each other's personal space, luckily at home. <br>
You giggle - inbetween our kisses - inbetween our tongues battling each other - and I giggle, admiring you, letting my mind intoxicate itself on the sound of your laughter, on the smell of your presence. <br>
Our bodies fight against each other as you push me towards the bed, a bed covered with white sheets and pillows. I fall, underneath you - you rest, atop me. We look into each other's eyes, totally aware of what're about to do - we giggle more. <br>
The universe within our bodies are being pulled together - closer and closer to each other. The novas within us are awaiting to clash against each other - to birth many more galaxies inbetween us. <br>
The gravitational pull between our body is exasperatingly strong and our bodies clung to each other's - the galaxies within you are getting pulled towards the black hole within me. <br>
We sigh again as you take another sip of your beer and tilt the neck of the bottle over my mouth, letting me have a sip too - a sip of this amaranthine bliss. <br>
I look at you as you reposition yourself and sit on top of me - with my hands on your waists. You smirk as you move your lower body, back and forth - taking another sip from your beer. <br>
You drink yourself closer to mindful ecstasy and I smell myself to mindful bliss. You and your alcohol. Me and your body. Like two clouds - grey and white - coming together to rain on the two of us. <br>
Watching you grind your hips on my body while taking a swig from the beer bottle, with a smirk on your face and a naughty sparkle in your eyes - I lie there, completely astounded and bewitched. <br>
Your bare neck and shoulders call out to me like a thirsty animal lost in a desert being called my mirages. The smirk plastered across your mouth makes my mind dizzy and parts of my body stiff and firm. <br>
And as you continue to grind on me, lost in your own mind and on your train of thoughts - your breasts jiggle, up and down, and hex my eyes to follow them wherever they go. <br>
You finish your drink and you look down at me, totally frozen, eyes stuck on to each other's, a smirk still on your face, hands resting on my chest, legs on either side of me, and then you move ever so slightly - biting your lower lip. <br>
You lean closer and breathe - onto my neck - and start to unbutton my shirt. I watch you, moving down - button after button, unbuttoning and revealing my skin. <br>
You kiss my nipples, one after the other, before revealing my front altogether. You watch the upper half of me, naked, bare chest, bare stomach, bare neck. You move ever so sllightly again - biting your lower lip. <br>
You look up into my eyes and mouth a 'mmm' towards me before you invite another smirk on your face, and a certain light in your eyes, winking once at me. <br>
You get off of me, my hands fall off your waists, you place your hand on my naked body, feeling my warm skin with your palm - while rubbing my lips with your other hand. <br>
You rub your hand over the hair on my lower body, scratching your fingers against my skin, making me grip your arms, tightly - letting a moan out of my mouth. <br>
You hold onto my moan, capturing it within your mind, playing it over and over again, reliving it, revisiting my moaning face before unbuckling my belt. <br>
You look down at my pants as you earnestly start to take it off of me - my lower body rises just a little as I assist you with lower my pants down. <br>
With both your hands, you push my pants down, revealing me in my boxers, a hard lump resting inside the boxers, ever so slowly twitching every few seconds. <br>
I use my legs to pull down the rest of my pants, letting my legs and my thighs breathe - breathe in the air mixed with your smell and the smell of alcohol. <br>
You place a palm on the hard knobkerrie hiding inside my boxers as it breathes in the smell of your body through your hand as you bite your lips again and look towards me - my eyes already fixed onto yours. <br>
My mouth slightly ajar, my eyes heavy with lust and horniness, my body warming up with every passing second, my breath rapid and irregular - I nod at you. <br>
Your lips curl into a huge smile, a grin on your face as you move your hand under and inside my boxers. The concept of time and reality stops, just then, for me. The coldness of your hand hesitates to mix with the warmth of my dick - like two poles of a magnet, like the south and the normal pole of a planet, like water and fire, like life and death. <br>
With your fingers wrapped around it, you look at me - my eyes closed and my mouth still ajar, moans escaping the abyss within me - my dick hardens in your hand, pulsing, streaks of liquid leaking through the slit on top. <br>
Unaware of your eyes on me, I hold onto you - tighter and tighter, drowning in extreme bliss, my brain sinking in an ocean of ecstasy. <br>
You lean closer and kiss my lips - my eye lids separate - gripping me back to reality. My tongue slides into your mouth and my hands find your body - taking off the strings of cloth holding your dress onto your body, off of your shoulders. <br>
Your dress falls, resting on your lower body as your breasts finally breathe the air surrounding us. Your chest heaving as your tongue finds its way into my mouth. <br>
I find your face with a one hand and your waist with the other. I get up - separating our tongues from each other - stopping the creation of life - a string of saliva departing from our mouths and falling on our chins. <br>
You look into my eyes, taken aback with the sudden movements - my eyes find yours and comfort you back into our safe space. I push my boxers down and off my legs. <br>
I stand beside the bed, on the cold floor - the cold rushes throughout my body and a chill runs down my spine and my dick hardens even more as it twitches in mid-air. <br>
A string of nectar, visibly, drips from my twitching dick as it hangs mid-air - found by your eager eyes as you follow the string hang from the slit. <br>
The most beautiful part of you - your eyes - I notice them stuck on the sweet nectar dripping from my dick as I use my finger to scoop up the sweetness and stick the finger in my mouth - maintaining eye contact with you throughout. <br>
A whole string of stars are born within your stomach as you get flushed with bliss and your heart is coated with happiness and contentment and your mind sinks into a pool of lust. <br>
Your eyes close as you stop the time within your mind and press play on the tape consisting of me standing naked in front of you and licking my own nectar from my dick with my fingers. <br>
Your breath gets heavy as you keep playing that moment, over and over, your mouth agape and your tongue resting on your lips. <br>
I smile watching you birth supernovas within yourself as I move closer to you and pull your dress down and off your body - finally grabbing you by your legs. <br>
My actions pull you back to reality as your eyes quickly open - finding me - staring at me and watching me reveal the entirety of you. <br>
I pull you by your legs as I bring you closer, your hips resting closer to the edge of the bed, your legs high in the air - held together by me. <br>
You sit - with your legs submitted to me - on your hips, hands supporting you from falling back on the bed - you bite your lips and question me and my thoughts with your eyes. <br>
I smirk at you as I move my hands down to your hips and grab onto the hem of your remaining piece of cloth covering the paradise between your legs - pulling it up your legs and off of you. <br>
I pause - finally - amazed at your nakedness. Your bare body, your bare legs, your bare chest, your bare breasts, your bare stomach, your bare waists, your bare neck, your bare thighs, your bareness. Your nakedness stupifies me as I stand, my dick erect, my body frozen. <br>
Your eyes closed, your mouth agape, you moan as your body breathes - the fresh air - and you realize your nakedness being observed by me - you moan - letting go off the support of your hands and falling back on the sheet. <br>
I take a deep breath and place your legs on either shoulder. I kiss every inch of your legs as I start to get on my knees - every so slowly - making sure to kiss every inch of your legs. <br>
My mouth rests between your godly thighs once I get on my knees - breathing between your legs - the fragrance intoxicates me instantly as my mind goes dizzy and my thoughts rush out the door, some stumbling on their way outside the window. <br>
You finally move your arms, finding my head as your fingers grip onto and into my hair as you keep your eyes closed - hoping for time to go as slowly as possible and as rapidly as possible - both at the same time. <br>
Several cans of paint tip over on the blank canvas inside your mind as they mix together and form an enigma that cannot be put into words. <br>
The sky within my mind lights up like the fourth of July - lights sparkling as bright as possible - explosions on every corner - happiness and bliss shooting and spurting everywhere. <br>
You feel my head move closer to between your legs as you grip onto my hair tightly and my tongue finds it way out of my mouth and into and inside your soft skin. <br> 
Your lower body rises as it pushes your soft skin more into my mouth and your hands pull my head deeper inside. <br>
With my hands wrapped around your thighs - yours gripping on my hair - your soft skin in my mouth - my tongue inside it - the night finally begins. A Night of You and Me. <br>
Sunlight seeps in through the window slits, falling on and over the sheets that cover our naked exhausted bodies, dissolving us in that ethereal radiance. <br>
I sit up and look at your sleeping face - a face so beautiful and so raw that it shakes my heart and makes me feel alive. <br>
I feel utterly and extremely proud of being there, with you, in that moment - being next to you, being a part of your life and a part of your happiness. <br>
I lean over and kiss your forehead and your face as I drown myself into this reality where we belong to each other and are with each other - only in this reality I would ever want to exist. <br>

That's the end of the poem. I know it wasn't what you thought it would be. I am sorry it was awfully long and boring. And unneccessarily sexual and explicit. I apologize for that. Anyway, I am yours. You are mine. Thank you.  
  </p>

<p>  
Yours lovingly,
  </p>
